# pokedex

A new Flutter project.

Small project to try out [graphql_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/graphql_flutter) and [graphql_codegen](https://pub.dev/packages/graphql_codegen)

Design inspired (and badly implemented by me) by [Bruna Campos](https://dribbble.com/shots/14241781-Pok-dex/attachments/5886808?mode=media)

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)
